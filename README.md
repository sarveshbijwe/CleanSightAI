## üí° Problem Statement
Maintaining cleanliness in large spaces is challenging when relying solely on manual inspections. Delays in spill detection, garbage accumulation, and maintenance oversight often lead to:
- Operational inefficiencies
- Increased maintenance costs
- Health and safety hazards

CleanSight AI solves these issues by:
- Using AI vision models on CCTV feeds to detect cleanliness issues in real-time.
- Assigning tasks automatically based on risk level and location.
- Generating analytics to improve cleaning strategies and response time.
